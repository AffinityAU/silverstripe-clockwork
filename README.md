SilverStripe Clockwork Integration
==================================

Integrates the wonderful Clockwork Chrome extension into Silverstripe. Out of
the box queries and controller events will be logged. You can also log your
own events on the timeline. 

* Clockwork: https://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork
* Chrome Extension: https://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork-chrome

NOTE: This extension is only active when your site is in dev mode. There should
be no slowdown in live mode because the database proxy adapter is not installed
and clockwork is never activated.


Usage
-----
Install the chrome extension. Install via composer. Basic timing and query 
logging work out of the box. To add your own events to the timeline use:

```
Injector::inst()->get('ClockworkTimeline')->startEvent('myevent1', 'Description of the event');

// ... do the things ... ///

// this will happen automatically when the request ends
Injector::inst()->get('ClockworkTimeline')->endEvent('myevent1');
```

You can also use SilverStripe's logging to output to Clockwork:

```php
SS_Log::log('Some error', Zend_Log::ERR);
```

Todo List
